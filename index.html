  <h1>Supporting Women and Underrepresented Minorities in Tech</h1>

  <img src="apple.jpg" alt="Woman using tech interface">

  <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong></p>
  <p>I chose this topic because I’m part of Women in Tech, and I see how hard it can be for women and minorities to break into the tech industry. Women make up only 23% of the tech workforce, and Black and Hispanic professionals represent just 7.4% and 10%. That’s a gap that needs to be closed.</p>

  <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fewer job opportunities and promotions</li>
    <li>Lack of mentorship and support</li>
    <li>Bias in hiring and workplace culture</li>
    <li>Limited access to funding and resources</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Technology Can Help</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentorship apps to connect underrepresented workers with experienced professionals</li>
    <li>AI tools to reduce hiring bias</li>
    <li>Online platforms for networking, job boards, and tech education</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💡 Plan to Address the Issue</h2>
  <p>This plan is focused on using technology to help reduce the barriers women and underrepresented minorities face in the tech industry. The goal is to design a mentorship and support platform that’s both inclusive and empowering. 💻🌸</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>🔍 Research what exists and where it fails:</strong> Explore current platforms like LinkedIn, ADPList, and tech bootcamp networks to identify gaps in mentorship, support, and accessibility.</li>
    <li><strong>📱 Build a better mentorship experience:</strong> Design a prototype app where users can filter mentors by identity, field, and goals to create more meaningful, relatable support connections.</li>
    <li><strong>🤖 Address the hiring pipeline:</strong> Use AI to anonymize resumes, reduce hiring bias, and help companies develop more equitable screening tools.</li>
    <li><strong>👩🏽‍💻 Create a community space:</strong> Include forums, events, chats, and safe spaces to uplift and support each other personally and professionally.</li>
    <li><strong>🎓 Share learning resources:</strong> Offer tech scholarships, career-building templates, and beginner resources for those breaking into the industry or changing careers.</li>
    <li><strong>🧪 Collect feedback:</strong> Test the prototype with students and professionals and use their input to improve features and accessibility.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>🛠️ How This Website Helps Address the Issue</h2>
  <p>My goal with this website wasn’t just to talk about the problem—it was to start building a solution. Here’s how the features and content directly connect to the key problems faced by women and underrepresented minorities in tech:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>🔍 Research what exists and where it fails:</strong> The site references platforms like LinkedIn, ADPList, and bootcamp networks, identifying where current tools fall short for underrepresented users.</li>
  
    <li><strong>📱 Build a better mentorship experience:</strong> The site outlines a mentorship app plan and includes a live comment section for users to share support and build connection—just a starting point for what the app could become.</li>
  
    <li><strong>🤖 Address the hiring pipeline:</strong> The app concept introduces anonymized resumes to reduce bias and make hiring fairer, and the website discusses how bias often shows up in hiring systems.</li>
  
    <li><strong>👩🏽‍💻 Create a community space:</strong> Visitors can leave comments and stories, creating a sense of shared space for encouragement and visibility—especially for those who don’t often feel represented in tech.</li>
  
    <li><strong>🎓 Share learning resources:</strong> The site includes helpful links to learning tools and articles, and introduces the idea of building out a full resource hub within the app in future stages.</li>
  
    <li><strong>🧪 Collect feedback:</strong> Users are encouraged to leave suggestions or share what they’d want to see in a real version of the app—this makes the project open to real, evolving needs.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This project is just the beginning. By combining research, design planning, and community sharing, the website shows how technology can actively be used to support inclusion, not just talk about it 💖💡.</p>

  <p>💬 <strong>“Women in tech are absolutely the computer geeks and the engineers, but they are also the lawyers, the policymakers, the activists. And at every level we need more of us.”</strong></p>

  <p>🎤 <strong>Sabina Ciofu</strong> from techUK delivered this powerful TEDx talk to spotlight how important it is to have diverse voices in tech and policy. She reminds us that building fair, effective technology means involving people from all walks of life—not just coders. Sabina’s work covers everything from AI to international trade policy 🇪🇺🤖, and she’s a real force in bridging the gap between tech and human rights 💡👩‍⚖️.</p>
